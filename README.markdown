>> Uses 37signals's Campfire API

I spent some time playing with the Campfire API but mainly I was looking to implement a messenger bot for Campfire. Currently, Cimpfo 0.1, has two parts:

* The Messenger Service
** Submits messages to Campfire
* The Twitter Requester
** Requests user updates from Twitter

I still have to tweak it so Twitter messages won't reappear once submitted. My goal is to add more publishers to the messenger service so I can 
have access to information where it might be blocked by firewall for example.

Fork it and give some feedback.
